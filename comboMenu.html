        <h2>Purpose of Program</h2>
        <p> This program simulates the process of a user interacting with a waiter or online menu. The user choses between a set of several menu options. The user can chose a main meal, a drink, and sides. The user can also chose not to add these items. This is aplicable to real life as more and more automation is needed in the restraunt industry as delivery becomes more popular. This code is of course limited as it does not utilie an affective user interface. To improve this we could combine the python code with an html form, or at the very least use tkinter to create a more user friendly experience

        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>Global Variables:
        <br> I did not use any global varriables for this program because it consisted of only one function. Many of my variables would have been functional as global varriables, it was simply unnessasary. I suppose it may have been useful to split the code into different helper functions, each of which could represent an iteration. If I split my code like that I would have a global variable of Total_cost.
        <br>
    <br>Local Variables:
  <br>Several of my variables that were used commonly throughout the function were defined at the top. This includes "name", "total_cost", and "inputonmenu". The variable name was not nessasary, but it was just a little way to add more personality to the code, as if the user was interacting with a real person. total_cost is added to continuously throughout the function as the user adds to or changes their order. The variable "inputonmenu" is used to check if the user has input an item on the menu, if the user has inputted something that is not on the menu the program will continue to prompt the user to input a new answer. The next "group" of variables is the input storage varriables. These varriables take the user input when the user is prompted to pick an item from the menu. This includes "sand_witch_choice", "Would_you_like_drink", "drink_type", "Would_you_like_Fries", "Fries_type", and "mega". These varriables will only change if the user inputs an item that is not on the menu.

        <h2>Conditions</h2>
        <p>
          The first conditional statements are used to eliminate user error. These conditions check for each of the possible menu items are in the user input. If the option is found the corrisponding price will be added to the total cost and the price will be logged. If no item is found the else statement will run, causing a prompt for the user to enter an item on the menu to re appear. This will continue until the user enters a valid input. The set of conditions is simmilar for all of the other conditions. One difference is in the fries itteration, where there is also a condition which checks if the user inputs small which will then give a futher option to "mega si_e" your order.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Python is different from the other platforms we have used in this class because it is entirely text based. This of course means that the programmer is now more responsible for error handling, and that we must now pay extra close attention to syntax, but text based allows the programmer to exercise far more freedom as you are not limited to the functions of blocks, and you don't need to worry about not knowing which blocks are availible. I really enjoy using python, I wish that I developed this program more, I feel as though I could have made it far more interesting. I am happy with my conditionals, at least relatively, I think that I made my code more robust than I would have before. I have a habbit of using long strings of conditionals in attempt to get rid of user error, but this time I used the bilt in functions of "in" and ".upper" to limit the amout of code I needed to write, and in the end make it more efficient.
